# AutoBot

An application you can use to send (spam) messages and annoy the life out of people. Contains an autoclicker and an autotyper, and the only unique functionality of this application is that it allows you to sequentially hit keys such as (ENTER) or (INSERT) on your keyboard. A full list of shortcuts to special characters and keys will be provided elsewhere, however the contents will be sourced from this website:

This application is written in AutoIT (for Windows) and Python (unreleased; for Mac). The Python(Mac) version will also work with Windows, however it is in your best interest to use the application written in AutoIT for Windows rather than the one written in Python. The folders exist purely for easy of access, and the contents of the folders also exist within the zip file (besides the zip file). You can view the contents of the zip file in each folder, and just click on the zip file to download it.

<i><b>In order to be able to run the app along with the tutorial button without crashing, you must install the ENTIRE AutoBot folder within the repository. Do not drag the .exe file out of the Resources folder, just make a shortcut and drag it onto your desktop or anywhere you want it.</b></i>
